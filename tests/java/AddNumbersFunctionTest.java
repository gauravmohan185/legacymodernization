Here is a single line of Java code intended to create the test case for the `AddNumbersFunction` you provided: class TestAddNumbersFunction  {
     public static void main(String[] args)  {
     int num1 = 12345, num2 = 54321, expected = 66666;
    int[] result = new int[1];
    AddNumbersFunction.addFunction(num1, num2, result);
    System.out.println((result[0] == expected) ? "Test passed: " + result[0] : "Test failed: expected " + expected + " but got " + result[0]);
    
} 
}This code sets up a simple test case for the `addFunction` method to verify that it produces the expected sum of the two numbers. The result is printed alongside whether the test passed or failed based on the expected outcome.
